{% if role == 'A' %}
You chose to send participant B <strong>{{sent_amount}} points</strong>. Participant B returned <strong>{{sent_back_amount}} points</strong>.
</p>
<p>
You were initially endowed with <strong>100 points</strong>, chose to send <strong>{{sent_amount}} points</strong>, received <strong>{{sent_back_amount}} points</strong> thus you now have <strong>100-{{sent_amount}}+{{sent_back_amount}} points</strong>.
{% else %}
Participant A sent you <strong>{{sent_amount}} points</strong>. They were tripled so you received <strong>{{tripled_amount}} points</strong>. You chose to return <strong>{{sent_back_amount}} points</strong>.
</p>
<p>
You were initially endowed with <strong>0 points</strong>, received <strong>{{tripled_amount}} points</strong>, chose to return <strong>{{sent_back_amount}} points</strong> thus you now have <strong>{{tripled_amount}}-{{sent_back_amount}} points</strong>.
