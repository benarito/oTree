In this study, you will be grouped randomly and anonymously with another 2 participants. All of you are initially given 100 points. One of you will be randomly assigned to be the buyer and the other 2 the sellers. You will learn your role prior to making any decision. Sellers and the buyer can trade for 3 periods.
</p>
<p>
The sellers will begin by choosing a price and a quality grade for their products, simultaneously and independently. Then the buyer will have the chance to purchase from one of the sellers at the price listed. Before purchase, the buyer will not observe grades. After purchase, the price and grade of the bought unit will be revealed to all. The grade can be high, medium, or low; higher grade costs more to produce and is worth more to the buyer. The table below shows production costs to the sellers and values to the buyer of different grades (in points):
</p>
<table class=table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Grade</th><th>High</th><th>Medium</th><th>Low</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Production Cost to Sellers</th>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Value to the Buyer</th>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>25</td>
        <td>15</td>
    </tr>

<p>
The buyer can buy up to 1 unit of the commodity during a period and each seller can produce up to 1 unit in a period. Unsold units are not produced and hence incur no cost.
</p>
<p>
The period earning for the buyer is:<br />
<strong>Buyer's earning = value of the grade purchased - seller's price</strong>
</p>
<p>
The period earning the sellers is:<br />
<strong>Seller's earning = seller's price - cost of grade produced</strong>
</p>
