<p>
You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. There are {{amount_shared}} points for you to divide. Both of you have to simultaneously and independently demand a portion of the {{amount_shared}} points for yourselves. If the sum of your demands is smaller or equal to {{amount_shared}}, both of you get what you demanded. If the sum of your demands is larger than {{amount_shared}}, both of you get nothing.
