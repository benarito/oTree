    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group of {{ players_per_group }} participants. Each participant in the group is given {{ endowment }} points. The group
        has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
        the project. Contribution could be any integer from 0 to {{ endowment }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The contributions of all {{ players_per_group }} participants are added up, the total contribution
        is multiplied by a factor of {{ efficiency_factor }}, and the resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is evenly split among all {{ players_per_group }}
        participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus the amount you did not contribute.
    </p>
    <p>
    The instructions are exactly the same for all participants and will remain visible for your convenience on the bottom of all pages.
